      b) Choose the **YY1_GRCHECK_\<YOUR_ID\>_CDS** (you can use filter field for that) and press **Select** 

         ![select bo](./img/cs_select_service.png)

      c) Repeat it with the **YY1_CHECKLIST_\<YOUR_ID\>_CDS** custom business object

         ![select bo](./img/cs_checklist_select_service.png)

### Task 2: Publish the Custom Communication Scenario
